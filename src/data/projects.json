      "description": "This is an apartment search and rating tool, developed as a final project at the Flatiron school. It uses a React/Redux front end and a Rails/Postgres back end. The app saves user preferences about crime, schools, commute, and amenities. It then accepts apartment addresses as inputs, queries five apis to retrieve data about the apartment's surrounding area, and synthesizes the results into a report, complete with numerical rating. The app also saves past searches. The name is a joke. Mostly.",
